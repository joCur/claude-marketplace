# Research Command

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research on the given topic. Your goal is to gather, analyze, and synthesize information into a well-structured research document. Follow these steps:

## Research Process

1. **Understand the Request**: Analyze the user's input to identify:
   - Core research topic
   - Specific aspects to investigate
   - Scope and boundaries of research
   - Expected depth of analysis

2. **Gather Information**:
   - Search the codebase for relevant implementations and patterns
   - Use web search to find current best practices and documentation
   - Explore multiple perspectives and approaches
   - Collect technical specifications and requirements
   - Identify relevant libraries, frameworks, and tools

3. **Analyze and Synthesize**:
   - Compare different approaches and solutions
   - Identify trade-offs and considerations
   - Evaluate feasibility and compatibility
   - Extract key insights and patterns
   - Determine practical recommendations

4. **Document Findings**: Save the research to `.claude/research/{TOPIC_NAME}.md` where TOPIC_NAME is a descriptive name based on the research topic

5. **Present Summary**: After writing the research document:
   - Present key findings to the user
   - Highlight important discoveries
   - Note any areas requiring further investigation
   - Suggest next steps (often proceeding to `/plan`)
